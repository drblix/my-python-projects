# Purpose: Encodes a quote into ASCII and asks the user to try and solve the quote

# Pseudocode:
# Introduction to program
# Display the random encoded message in ASCII
# Input: Ask the user if they'd like to solve it letter by letter
# If yes, loop through each character in the list and have the user try and solve it (provide an ascii table) link: ("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/ASCII-Table-wide.svg")
# If no, just display the message
